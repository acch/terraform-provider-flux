        This form is meant as a catch-all for issues that do not fit into one of the other existing forms:

        * Report a Bug
        * Report a Documentation Error
        * Request an Enhancement
        * Repository/Meta

        By nature this form is less rigid, so providing a bit of additional information, context, or reference material is very much appreciated.
